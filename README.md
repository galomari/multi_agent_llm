Create Agents to Research and Write an Article
This project explores the foundational concepts of multi-agent systems, providing hands-on experience with the crewAI framework. Through this repository, users will learn to create and utilize multiple agents to perform research and collaboratively write articles.

Overview
This repository is part of a structured course aimed at introducing multi-agent systems, specifically leveraging the capabilities of crewAI for efficient research and article writing. The primary objectives include understanding agent-based architecture, deploying multiple agents, and utilizing these agents to automate research workflows.

Features
Agent-Based Framework: Uses crewAI to facilitate multi-agent collaboration.
Research and Writing Automation: Agents collectively contribute to researching a topic and drafting content.
Flexible Environment Setup: Ready to run in the classroom environment or on local setups.
